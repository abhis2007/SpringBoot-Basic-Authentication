    * 1. For basic authentication password will be generated randomly.
    * 2. We can override the password and username from property page.
    * 3. Like - spring.security.user.name & spring.security.user.password
    *
    * 4. At this instance all the endpoints are fully secured, but we may not need to login/authenticate all the pages
    * Hence we may need something called to ignore some of the request, we can achieve the same with the SecurityFilterChain.
    *
    * 5. Exception Handling - Created custom exception where we can set the multiple http status and message.
